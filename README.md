# Music-Store-Database-Analysis
Welcome to the Music Store Database Analysis repository! This project explores a PostgreSQL-based music store database through various SQL queries, answering key analytical questions related to music tracks, albums, artists, and genres. The goal is to provide insights into the storeâ€™s performance, popular genres, top artists, and more.


# Overview

This repository contains SQL queries that explore and analyze the music store database. Using PostgreSQL, we can extract meaningful insights, such as:
1. Top 10 artists with the most tracks.
2. The most popular genres.
3. The number of tracks in each album.
4. Average track length by genre.
5. Sales analysis by album, artist, and genre.


You will be able to explore these and many other questions using the SQL queries provided in this repository.

## Database Schema
The database consists of the following key tables:
